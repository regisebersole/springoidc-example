# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Spring Boot Java REST API that provides a robust, scalable web service foundation. The API will follow REST architectural principles and leverage Spring Boot's auto-configuration and embedded server capabilities to deliver a production-ready service with proper error handling, validation, and documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Spring Boot application with proper project structure, so that I can build upon a well-organized foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a Spring Boot application with embedded Tomcat server
2. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL organize code into proper packages (controller, service, model, repository)
3. IF Maven is used THEN the system SHALL include necessary Spring Boot dependencies in pom.xml
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL be accessible on a configurable port (default 8080)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods, so that I can interact with resources using standard REST conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to a resource endpoint THEN the system SHALL return the requested data with HTTP 200 status
2. WHEN a POST request is made with valid data THEN the system SHALL create a new resource and return HTTP 201 status
3. WHEN a PUT request is made with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the existing resource and return HTTP 200 status
4. WHEN a DELETE request is made to an existing resource THEN the system SHALL remove the resource and return HTTP 204 status
5. WHEN invalid HTTP methods are used THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want proper request/response handling with JSON format, so that I can easily integrate with the service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request contains JSON data THEN the system SHALL automatically deserialize it to Java objects
2. WHEN a response is returned THEN the system SHALL serialize Java objects to JSON format
3. WHEN malformed JSON is sent THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with error details
4. WHEN content-type is not application/json for POST/PUT THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want OIDC authentication support, so that I can securely access protected endpoints using industry-standard authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing protected endpoints without authentication THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
2. WHEN a valid OIDC token is provided THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and allow access
3. WHEN Google is configured as OIDC provider THEN the system SHALL accept Google-issued JWT tokens
4. WHEN other OIDC providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support multiple OIDC providers simultaneously
5. WHEN an invalid or expired token is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with appropriate error message
6. WHEN token validation fails THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
7. IF user roles are present in token claims THEN the system SHALL extract and use them for authorization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can understand what went wrong when requests fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a resource is not found THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 with descriptive error message
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with field-specific error details
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with generic error message (no sensitive data exposed)
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
5. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 Forbidden

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want input validation and data binding, so that the API only processes valid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN request data is received THEN the system SHALL validate required fields are present
2. WHEN data types are incorrect THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with field names
3. WHEN string length limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate validation messages
4. WHEN email format is invalid THEN the system SHALL return format validation errors
5. IF custom validation rules exist THEN the system SHALL apply them and return specific error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API documentation, so that consumers can understand how to use the endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide Swagger/OpenAPI documentation endpoint
2. WHEN accessing the documentation THEN the system SHALL display all available endpoints with parameters
3. WHEN viewing endpoint details THEN the system SHALL show request/response schemas and examples
4. WHEN testing is needed THEN the system SHALL provide interactive API testing interface

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want a React TypeScript frontend application, so that users can interact with the API through a web interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend application starts THEN the system SHALL serve a Vite-powered React TypeScript application
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a Hello World interface
3. WHEN users need to authenticate THEN the system SHALL provide login functionality using OIDC
4. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store and manage authentication tokens securely
5. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL include the access token in request headers
6. IF the user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login flow

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure authentication using OIDC with PKCE flow, so that my credentials are protected during the login process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating login THEN the frontend SHALL generate PKCE code verifier and challenge
2. WHEN redirecting to OIDC provider THEN the frontend SHALL include PKCE challenge in authorization request
3. WHEN receiving authorization code THEN the frontend SHALL exchange it for tokens using PKCE code verifier
4. WHEN tokens are received THEN the frontend SHALL obtain an opaque access token for backend communication
5. WHEN the access token expires THEN the frontend SHALL refresh it automatically using refresh token
6. WHEN logout is requested THEN the frontend SHALL clear tokens and redirect to OIDC provider logout

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to validate opaque access tokens and issue session JWTs with timeout policies, so that I can manage user sessions securely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving an opaque access token for the first time THEN the backend SHALL validate it with the OIDC provider
2. WHEN token validation succeeds THEN the backend SHALL extract user information and create a session JWT
3. WHEN issuing session JWT THEN the backend SHALL include user ID, roles, last activity time, and session creation time
4. WHEN session JWT is created THEN the backend SHALL set inactivity timeout to 20 minutes
5. WHEN session JWT is created THEN the backend SHALL set maximum session duration to 24 hours from creation
6. WHEN receiving session JWT in subsequent requests THEN the backend SHALL validate it locally and update last activity time
7. WHEN 20 minutes pass without activity THEN the backend SHALL consider the session expired and require re-authentication
8. WHEN 24 hours pass since session creation THEN the backend SHALL expire the session regardless of activity
9. WHEN session JWT expires due to inactivity or maximum duration THEN the backend SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
10. WHEN token validation fails THEN the backend SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want health checks and monitoring, so that I can ensure the service is running properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a health check is requested THEN the system SHALL return application status and dependencies
2. WHEN metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL expose application metrics endpoint
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL log startup information and configuration
4. IF external dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL report unhealthy status with details
